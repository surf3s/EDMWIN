**EDMWIN**

If you have never used the program, before download and install from this [zip file](https://www.oldstoneage.com/static/osa/tech/software/edmwin/edmwin_setup.zip).  This will install the various libraries and a very out of date version of the program.  Then replace this installed version of the program with the one from the link provided here below.  One installed, you should be able to place the edmwin.exe program anywhere on your computer you want.

This folder contains the latest build.  Click [here](https://github.com/surf3s/EDMWIN/raw/main/Windows/edmwin.exe) to download.
